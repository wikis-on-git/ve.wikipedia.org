There was once a ship is called, the Celestial Maria.  The equipment of 10, was some of the sailors finer than they could be found.  With the crew ready and the cargo set, they set sail for South America. On the first day of the trip, captain, Senor Briggs, found something strange in the his ship. He found tracks leading from the cargo of the ship all the way around, throughout the whole interior ship ending back where they started. The captain did not understand, he asked the crew to get together. When they had assembled he asked them if anyone had been walking around last night. No one replied. One man raised his hand. The captain said to speak to him. His name was Edward, and he cleaned up the boat. He asked the captain if he was asking about the footprints. The captain replied yes. They disturbed to the captain, he knew that chef had not gone away all the day.  Then the captain noticed that two of the equipment lacked.  Its name was Lorenson, but the equipment called boy.  Hardly then Lorenson came storming underneath the ship.  The captain asked to him "where téngale been".  Outside the breathing and he wets, answered Lorenson "that cleaned upon sir of the kitchen" chef then interupted "what you mean to him you were cleaning he, I cleaned it same."  Lorenson that watched will refrán timid, answered "something it fell well and I cleaned it for above."  The then captain again requested each one to work.  It then went underneath cover to see the position again, and to his suprise, the tracks were goings.  And in his place, it was a put great writing X through the floor.  ..blood was written in a certain type of the red painting....  The then captain passed the cover superficially, seeing most of his equipment, but not to the crew member who lacks.  The then captain decided to ask boy if he knew where it was the disappear.  He said that he did not know.  The sun fixed and the captain said to them that all could go to sleep.  For now, he would try to solve where it was the disappear.  Whereas the captain seated in the near darkness, he asked himself if the red spots were blood of the disappear.  Whereas it seated in the darkness, he heard a strong wind blow through the ship.  All the equipment was slept, but he heard strange sounds in the dark, almost as somebody walked.  The captain did scared.  In the dark, it was safe he was single, he was safe that the equipment was slept, but he now oía steps.  Worried, he decided to call it one night and to verify in the morning outside things.  The morning came the equipment began to make its works daily.  The captain, after issuing some orders, decided to go check outside how the things were in the position.  They stuned the captain reason why it found.  The red X, was gone.
