 The Thathe Vondo forest is the so-called "Sacred Forest". The Thathe Vondo forest has giant hardwoods (jakkelsbessie, yellowwood), a wide variety of ferns, creepers and a wealth of plants and trees which makes the forest nearly impenetrable on foot. The Sacred Forest is a mystical place, where no ordinary VhaVhenda people may walk and as a visitor one may not walk off the dirt track going through the forest - hikers are not allowed. In the Sacred Forest two mythical creatures keep guard namely the white lion (the spirit of Nethathe an important chief) and the thunder and lighting bird called Ndadzi which according to myths flies on the wings of thunder. One can speculate further about this bird and its origin, and the origin of the vhaVhenda people. Can we make a comparison between this bird and similar mythical birdlike figures in North Africa (Egypt)? Ndadzi's eyes flash lighting, from in its beak it bears rain and when it drops an egg at a foot of a tree this tree will be destroyed by fire. As previously stated, myths, religion and believes have their origin in how a specific society experiences their environment at a specific time. Myths always have their origin in an experienced reality. Some important chiefs from the Thathe clans have apparently been reburied (according to believe) in a cave in this forest, protected by the white lion and Ndadzi.The former homeland of Venda is now part of the Northern Province and is the home of the Vahvenda people. Lake Fundudzi and Thathe Vondo Sacred Forest are important sites for Venda mythology. Home of the python god, Lake Fundudzi is sacred and can only be visited with permission from the priestess of the lake. There are a number of trails through the forest and hikers can view the lake from the surrounding hills. 

The ruins of the Tshiungane stone fortifications, near Sagole, are worth a visit, even if just to see the largest baobab in Africa. Ceremonial domba drums are made at the nearby village of Mutale. Visitors can watch the domba dance, which is performed during the months of September to December. Venda herbalists and diviners can also be visited by arrangement.
